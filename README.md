#Weather Data Analysis and Temperature Prediction

Project Goal: To predict the maximum daily temperature (tmax) for a weather station using a Ridge Regression model.

Methodology:

Data Collection and Cleaning:
Weather data loaded from the "3954644.csv" file.
Handling missing values, irrelevant features and data type transformation.
Feature Engineering:
Calculating statistical summaries, transforming existing features and temporal dependencies.
Model Building and Evaluation:
Using Ridge Regression for prediction.
Backtesting the model for performance evaluation and tuning.
Model Deployment and Monitoring:
Deploy the model for generating predictions on new data.
Monitor the model performance over time.
Results and Conclusions:

The Ridge Regression model effectively predicts the maximum temperature with a mean absolute error.
Visualization and analysis of errors are included.
Key Libraries Used: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Dataset Used: Weather data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).
